# Pi-Hole - Youtube Ads Blocker

![](https://deividsdocs.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/image.png)

This script will block all the Youtube's advertisement in your network. It must be used with Pi-Hole.

## Installation
- Download the script 
  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/deividgdt/ytadsblocker.git
  ```
- Move to the directory
  
  ```sh
  cd ytadsblocker
  ```
- Make the script executable
   
   ```sh
   chmod a+x ytadsblocker.sh
   ```
- Execute the script as root with the option: -a install
  
  ```sh
  ./ytadsblocker.sh -a install
  ```
  
- You can install the script using the aggressive mode. The aggressive mode will block every googlevideo's subdomain. Use carefully since this could lead to Youtube stop working.
  ```sh
  ./ytadsblocker.sh -a install -m aggressive
  ```

- Start the service and that's it
  
  ```sh
  systemctl start ytadsblocker
  ```

## Installation: Pihole container
If you are going to use the script in a Pihole Docker Container, you must install and start the script as follow:

- Go into the Pihole container

  ```sh
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deividgdt/ytadsblocker/master/ytadsblocker.sh
  ```

- Give it execution permission

  ```sh
  chmod +x ytadsblocker
  ```
  
- Install and start the script

  ```sh
  ./ytadsblocker.sh -a install
  ./ytadsblocker.sh -a start &
  ```

## Legacy: prior to Pihole 5.0

- First, consider upgrading Pihole to get nice and brand new features
- Just download the legacy version and follow the same previous steps, changing the name from `ytadsblocker` to `ytadsblocker_legacy`.

## More info
- Version 3.0 just works with Pihole 5.0 or newer. If you're running a lower version of Pihole, you must upgrade it.
